Ok,  this was a quick run adapted from the LKE version of the script to grab the IP address of Linode's with specific labels and then update a Managed DB ACL. 


"SHOULD" work rather well. 

At some point I'll add alerting... 
- Slack alert for failure
- Maybe something for centrallized logging to look back and then view in grafana?
